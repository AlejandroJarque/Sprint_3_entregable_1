## In this release, I've refactored the OlympicGames program according to the S principle of SOLID, which states that each class should have its own responsibilities, freeing them from excess functions and generating clearer, cleaner code. At this point, the Athletess class represents the athletes and their information, as does the Events class, which represents the events. The Results class is responsible for collecting all the information, while the OlympicGames class displays it in an organized manner.

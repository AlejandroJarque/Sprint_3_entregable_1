## In this first exercise, I created an abstract Instrument class and implemented a ToPlay interface for it. From there, I simply represented each instrument with its own class. This system is more efficient because it allows me to extend the code as much as I want without having to modify the core of my program. Tomorrow I could add a violin class, and the day after a trumpet class, and so on.

## In this case, I've refactored the code so that it's not necessary to introduce unnecessary functions into the different classes. We have a Washing Machine class and a Water Heater class. What we've done is create three different interfaces to give each appliance the functions it needs, such as washing for the washing machine or heating for the water heater. But we've also included a two-function interface that represents turning a machine on and off, an interface that both classes share.
